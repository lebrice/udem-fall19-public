Here are the modifications I performed on the lf_slim.launch file:

In order to simplify debugging this, I chose to establish a convention
whereby I always only remap the subscribers such that they use the topic name chosen by the publisher.
This helped me greatly in making sense of this file.


1- Added a remap inside the group containing the gymdt node.
    Since the gymdt node is subscribing to the wheels_cmd event, it needs to point to that event on the inverse_kinematics node. (the publisher)
    <group>
        <!-- START ADDED -->
        <remap from="$(arg veh)/wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd" to="/$(arg veh)/inverse_kinematics_node/wheels_cmd" />
        <!-- END ADDED -->
        <node name="gymdt" pkg="gymdt" type="gymdt_node.py" />
    </group>

2- Connect the line detection and groud projection with the segment_list topic:
    <!-- START ADDED -->
    <remap from="ground_projection/lineseglist_in" to="line_detector_node/segment_list"/>
    <!-- END ADDED -->
                
3- Connect the lane controller's car_cmd topic to the lane_filter, which requires it.
    <!-- START ADDED -->
        <remap from="lane_filter_node/car_cmd" to="lane_controller_node/car_cmd"/>
    <!-- END ADDED -->

4- Remove the remap within the inverse_kinematic node, following the convention described above (and following change #1)
    <!-- START REMOVED -->            
        <!-- <remap from="inverse_kinematics_node/wheels_cmd" to="wheels_driver_node/wheels_cmd" /> -->
    <!-- END REMOVED -->
